## 💡 Inspiration
I wanted to create an app that would engage users in a fun and interactive way while still providing valuable educational content. I believe that learning should be fun, and Enkokilish does just that!

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started with Enkokilish, simply clone the repository and run npm install to install all dependencies. Once the dependencies are installed, run npm start to start the development server.

## 🎮 How to Play
To start playing Enkokilish, select the topic you want to be quizzed on from the home page. The app will then generate a series of questions related to that topic, and you'll have a limited amount of time to answer each one.

Once you've completed the quiz, you'll receive your score and can choose to play again or select a different topic.

## 🌟 Features
Engaging and educational quiz gameplay
Multiple topics to choose from
Randomly generated questions for each game
